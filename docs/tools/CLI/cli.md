<h1 id="mbed-cli">Overview</h1>

Many experienced developers prefer to work offline. To meet this need, Arm provides Arm Mbed CLI, a command-line tool packaged as `mbed-cli` and based on Python.

Mbed CLI enables Git- and Mercurial-based version control, dependencies management, code publishing, support for remotely hosted repositories (GitHub, GitLab and mbed.org), use of the Arm Mbed OS build system, export functions and other operations.

This document covers the installation and usage of Mbed CLI. You can find our legacy CLI documentation in the [README](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli/blob/1.8.3/README.md).

## Feedback

We're keen to learn about your experience with Mbed CLI on other operating systems at the [Mbed CLI development page](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli).
