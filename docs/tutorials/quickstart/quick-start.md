<h1 id="quick-start">Arm Mbed OS quick start</h1>

This quick start covers selecting your target in the Arm Online Compiler and creating your first application. It also teaches you how to flash your target and how to interact with your device.

The quick start example blinks the LED on your board on and off. The main thread also takes a snapshot of the device's runtime statistics and displays them over a serial connection to your PC. Once you have this application working, you can use the documentation the quick start links to - a broad range of examples, conceptual tutorials and end-to-end applications - to add functionality.

You can choose to develop **online** or **offline**:

- For online development, we provide the Arm Mbed Online Compiler. This is a great choice if you want to get started working with Mbed OS quickly.

- For offline development, we provide Arm Mbed CLI, our command-line tool. Mbed CLI is compatible with Windows, Linux and macOS. Mbed CLI provides more options, but requires slightly more setup.
